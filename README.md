# ELK Stack Cookbook

## ELK

The ELK stack is a group of tools used to show information about immutable infrastructure without having to go into the machines.

The tools within this cookbook are:

- [x] Elasticsearch - A way to search and store (JSON format) through logs. Kibana uses this to get the information to display

- [x] Logstash - A store of all the commands and requests you configure it to store

- [x] Kibana - Uses the log from logstash to show stats in a graphical way.
